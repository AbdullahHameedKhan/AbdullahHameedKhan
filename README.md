Welcome to my digital workshop! 🛠️ Here, I'm building, experimenting, and sharing my adventures in tech. 🚀

### 👨‍💻 A bit about me:

- 🔭 **Currently working on**: Leading **AI projects** at GradientArc & Ogoul Technology, with a focus on **deep learning**, **reinforcement learning**, and **advanced transformer models** like **LLMs** and **LAMs**.
- 🌱 **Currently learning**: Continuously advancing in **MLOps** practices for efficient deployment, monitoring, and scaling of AI solutions.
- 🤝 **Looking to collaborate on**: Innovative projects that push the boundaries of AI in fields like **NLP**, **computer vision**, and **voice cloning**.
- 🧐 **Looking for help with**: Exploring cutting-edge techniques in **transformer architectures** and **low-latency voice models**.
- 💬 **Ask me about**: LLMs, reinforcement learning, custom TTS models, and my journey in building a **Character.ai Replica**.
- 📫 **How to reach me**: [LinkedIn](https://pk.linkedin.com/in/abdullah-hameed-8826281a0)
- 😄 **Pronouns**: He/Him
- 🦄 **Fun fact**: I’m an AI engineer by day, but a secret tech wizard by night 🧙‍♂️. Currently growing my own startup alongside my work at Funsol!

### 🛠 Tech Stack:
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face
- **Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Langchain
- **Specialties**: Voice Cloning, Generative AI, Transformer Architectures, MLOps

### 🚀 What I’ve built:
- **Character.ai Replica**: Leveraged Llama 3, Stable Diffusion, and low-latency speech models for a seamless interactive experience.
- **FaceApp Replica**: Engineered an app for facial transformation using GANs and style-transfer techniques.
- **Otter Meeting App**: Integrated Whisper and GPT APIs for accurate meeting transcription and summarization.

Here’s to building something amazing together! ✨
